   * Notes:
     1. Class Explorer is responsible for setting exploration, and class Generator
        is responsible for CNF generatoin.



COMPILATION

   1. Compiling the ABC library "libabc.a":
      Go to the abc/ directory, and use

         make libabc.a READLINE=0 PTHREADS=0

      to compile the library.

      * Note: This may consume much time.

   2. Compiling "glucose_exp" for exploration:
      Go to glucose_exp/core, and use

         make

      to compile "glucose_exp".

      * Note: The generated executable has the name "glucose". Please use

                 mv glucose glucose_exp

              to change its name.

   3. Compiling the program "expcnf":
      Move the ABC library (libabc.a) from abc/ to src/. Go to src/ and use

         make

      to compile the program.



EXECUTION

   1. Put "expcnf" and "glucose_exp" in the same directory.
   
   2. Command-line syntax:
      Exploration
         expcnf -exp <sample1.v> <sample2.v> <sample3.v> <EncoderSetting> <SATSolverSetting>
      Generation
         expcnf -gen <EncoderSetting> <test.v> <CnfOutput>
